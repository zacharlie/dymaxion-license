DYMAXION LICENSE ATTRIBUTIONS

VERSION 0.1

# General

This has been a long time in the making and drew inspiration from many sources, including the most prolific open source licenses.

# Initiation

The idea was started (with parts of the description and license already written) many years prior to publication,
however the tipping point that pushed the author to publish was the reading of the license file from the baserow project.
